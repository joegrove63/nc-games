Deployed version: https://boardgamers.netlify.app/

This project is the front-end architecture to interact with my back-end project: https://github.com/joegrove63/be-nc-games. I built a website with React that was a hub for all board game enthusiasts where people could review board games, people can comment, up-vote or down-vote each review much like reddit. I used technologies including React, with packages React-Router and React-Router-Dom, HTML and CSS for the styling, and I made use of React hooks throughout the project. I interacted with my back-end project using HTTP request types and HTTP response codes to update my UI, also making asynchronous API calls to my server for instant results.

Minimum version of Node 15.11.0
